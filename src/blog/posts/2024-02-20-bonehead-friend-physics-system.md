# Building Bonehead Friend: A Physics Playground

Bonehead Friend started as a simple idea: what if you could have a digital fidget toy that actually felt satisfying to play with? The result is a physics-based game that runs in the background while you work, providing a calming, interactive experience.

## The Core Concept

Unlike traditional games that demand your full attention, Bonehead Friend is designed to be a **peripheral experience**. It's meant to occupy that part of your brain that might otherwise fidget with a pen or bounce your leg while you're thinking.

## Physics as Gameplay

The entire game revolves around realistic physics interactions. Every element responds to forces, collisions, and environmental factors in predictable ways.

### Rigid Body Dynamics

```gdscript
# Core physics object setup
extends RigidBody2D

@export var bounce_factor: float = 0.8
@export var drag_coefficient: float = 0.02
@export var interaction_force: float = 500.0

func _ready():
    # Set up physics properties
    gravity_scale = 1.0
    linear_damp = drag_coefficient
    angular_damp = 0.1
    
    # Connect collision signals
    body_entered.connect(_on_collision)

func _on_collision(body):
    # Add bounce effect with energy conservation
    var collision_force = linear_velocity.length()
    if collision_force > 50:
        apply_impulse(Vector2.UP * collision_force * bounce_factor)
```

## Interactive Elements

### Mouse Interaction System

The most important aspect of Bonehead Friend is how it responds to user input. We wanted interactions to feel natural and physically plausible.

```gdscript
# Mouse interaction handler
extends Node2D

var dragging_body: RigidBody2D = null
var drag_offset: Vector2

func _input(event):
    if event is InputEventMouseButton:
        if event.pressed:
            _start_drag(event.position)
        else:
            _end_drag()
    elif event is InputEventMouseMotion and dragging_body:
        _update_drag(event.position)

func _start_drag(mouse_pos: Vector2):
    var space_state = get_world_2d().direct_space_state
    var query = PhysicsPointQueryParameters2D.new()
    query.position = mouse_pos
    
    var result = space_state.intersect_point(query)
    if result.size() > 0:
        dragging_body = result[0].collider
        drag_offset = mouse_pos - dragging_body.global_position

func _update_drag(mouse_pos: Vector2):
    if dragging_body:
        var target_pos = mouse_pos - drag_offset
        var force = (target_pos - dragging_body.global_position) * 1000
        dragging_body.apply_force(force)
```

## Environmental Systems

### Gravity Wells

One of our favorite features is the gravity well system, which creates localized gravitational fields that objects can orbit around.

```gdscript
# Gravity well implementation
extends Area2D

@export var gravity_strength: float = 1000.0
@export var max_range: float = 200.0

func _ready():
    body_entered.connect(_on_body_entered)
    body_exited.connect(_on_body_exited)

var affected_bodies: Array[RigidBody2D] = []

func _physics_process(delta):
    for body in affected_bodies:
        if is_instance_valid(body):
            var distance = global_position.distance_to(body.global_position)
            var direction = (global_position - body.global_position).normalized()
            var force = direction * gravity_strength / (distance * distance)
            body.apply_force(force)
```

## Performance Considerations

Running a physics simulation in the background requires careful optimization:

### Object Pooling
We use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed particles and effects:

```gdscript
# Simple object pool
class_name ObjectPool

var pool: Array = []
var scene_template: PackedScene

func get_object():
    if pool.is_empty():
        return scene_template.instantiate()
    else:
        return pool.pop_back()

func return_object(obj):
    obj.reset()  # Custom reset method
    pool.push_back(obj)
```

### Adaptive Quality
The simulation adjusts its quality based on system performance:

```gdscript
func _process(delta):
    # Monitor frame rate and adjust physics steps
    if Engine.get_frames_per_second() < 30:
        Engine.physics_ticks_per_second = 30
    else:
        Engine.physics_ticks_per_second = 60
```

## Visual Polish

### Particle Effects
We added subtle particle effects to enhance the feeling of physicality:

- **Collision sparks** when objects hit with sufficient force
- **Dust clouds** when objects slide across surfaces
- **Ripple effects** in fluid areas

### Shader Effects
Custom shaders add visual interest without impacting performance:

```glsl
// Simple rim lighting shader
shader_type canvas_item;

uniform float rim_power : hint_range(0.0, 10.0) = 2.0;
uniform vec4 rim_color : hint_color = vec4(1.0);

void fragment() {
    vec2 centered_uv = UV - 0.5;
    float rim = 1.0 - dot(centered_uv, centered_uv) * 4.0;
    rim = pow(rim, rim_power);
    
    COLOR = texture(TEXTURE, UV);
    COLOR.rgb += rim_color.rgb * rim;
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Physics Stability
Maintaining stable physics at varying framerates required careful tuning of physics parameters and implementing frame-rate independent calculations.

### 2. User Expectations
Players expect immediate feedback from interactions. Even a 50ms delay can make interactions feel sluggish.

### 3. Background Performance
Running as a background application means being conservative with CPU usage while still maintaining the illusion of a living, breathing world.

## Future Enhancements

We're planning several updates to Bonehead Friend:

- **Custom physics materials** with different properties
- **Sound integration** with spatial audio
- **Customizable environments** and themes
- **Multi-monitor support** for larger play areas

Bonehead Friend represents our exploration into **ambient gaming** - experiences that enhance rather than interrupt your daily workflow. It's been a fascinating journey into the intersection of physics simulation and user experience design.
