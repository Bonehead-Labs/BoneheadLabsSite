# The Beginning... üöÄ

Wow, I guess it's really happening! Bonehead Labs has officially kicked off.
If you'd asked me five years ago whether I'd ever thought this dream was possible, I would have said *absolutely not*!
But here we are‚Äîthanks to the power of amazing learning platforms and AI tools, creating a workflow to deliver real value has never been more accessible. And through Bonehead Labs, we're committed to bringing that value straight to you!

> "It's hard to see how far you've come if you can't see where you've been."  

That's the philosophy driving us forward‚Äîtransparency, growth, and a whole lot of fun along the way.

## The Blog üìù

This blog will be our go-to medium for diving into the more intricate parts of the company's operations.
I'll be sharing detailed development insights from our upcoming projects, with the goal of inspiring and helping other developers on their software engineering journeys.

Here, we'll celebrate our achievements and reflect on our failures, always with an eye toward growth and learning.

## Overall Plan üó∫Ô∏è

During my time learning the Godot game engine, I've whipped up a couple of small projects. As you can imagine, these early efforts‚Äîwhile a blast to create‚Äîare pretty minimal and a bit untidy.
The first step is to polish them up and reframe them as official open-source demos. These two projects are:
- **Apple Man Sam** (my very first game ever developed)
- **Pete the Pig**

While they're unpolished, showcasing these games is a key part of the philosophy I want this company to embody: **transparency**.
It's all about sharing the full journey, from rough starts to refined results.

### Bonehead Friend ü§ñ
Bonehead Friend will be our first official, polished game product. This is the next big release on the horizon‚Äîit won't have an open-source repo, but it *will* be **free to play**.
I'm aiming for this to be our debut on Steam, and I can't wait to share it with the world!

### Bonehead Labs Official Systems üõ†Ô∏è
This project is set to be one of our flagship products: an open-source repo of reusable Godot modules that can plug into any game. It's our big vision, and development is already underway.
I expect a preliminary version of all the modules to drop relatively quickly, but these systems will evolve over time‚Äîespecially as the Godot engine itself continues to grow and improve.

## Closing Thoughts üåü

I'm beyond excited to embark on this journey with Bonehead Labs, and I hope you'll join us every step of the way. Whether you're a developer, a gamer, or just curious about what we're cooking up, there's something here for you. Stay tuned for more updates.
