# The Beginning...

Wow, I guess it's really happening! Bonehead labs has kicked off.
Had you have asked me five years ago if I'd have thought this dream was possible, I would have said absolutely not!
Alas here we are, through the power of amazing learning platforms and A.I tools, a workflow to deliver value has never been more accessible, and through bonehead labs, we are sure to create value for you!


## The Blog.

This blog will serve as our medium for communicating the more intricate parts of the companie's operations.
I aim to share more detailed development information for our upcoming projects, in the hopes of inspiring and assisting other developers in their software engineering journey.

Here we will celebrate achievements, and reflect on failures, always focusing on growth.

## Overall Plan.

In my time learning the godot game engine, I have created a couple of small projects. As you can imagine these projects, whilst fun, are quite minimal and untidy.
The first step, is to tidy up these projects, and reframe them as official open-source demos. These two projects are:
- Apple Man Sam (first game ever developed)
- Pete the Pig 
Whilst unpolished, showcasing these games is an important part of the philosophy I wish this company to embody, and that is **transparency**.
It's hard to see how far you've come, if you can't see where you've been.

**Bonehead Friend**
Bonehead friend will be our first official, polished game product. This will be the next item released, and will not have an open source repot, but will be **free to play**.
I aim for this to be the first project available on steam.

**Bonehead-labs official systems**
This project is aimed to be one of our big products, an open source repot of re-usable godot modules that can be used in any game. This is our vision, and is currently in development.
I expect a preliminary version of all modules to be released relatively quickly, but these systems will definitely evolve over a long period of time, especially as the overarching engine develops.
