# Pete the Pig - Demo

Pete the Pig now has a demo available under the bonehead labs brand. It has been previously available under my personal aliases, but can now only be accessed via the following links:

- https://github.com/Bonehead-Labs/Pete-The-Pig
- https://bonehead-labs.itch.io/pete-the-pig

It is playable in the browser and also has the option to download a more stable exe.

# What is Pete the Pig?

Pete the Pig is a platformer, inspired by classic platformers like Mario, but with a few modern tweaks and a charming setting.
**The Goal** is to collect all of the briefcases in each level.
Controls are snappy both on the ground and in the air, aiming for a precision focussed experience.
Navigate the levels correctly to obtain all the briefcases in the shortest time possible

__Disclaimer__: Pete the pig has two instances of sill coarse language, and there are two pictures of owen wilson in this game...yes I think it is funny! These will eventually be removed so enjoy/be puzzled by their inclusion whilst you can!

# What is planned?
Ever heard of Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Star Wars? Well, the backstory of Pete the Pig will bring all of those to shame!!
In all seriousness, there is a fun storyline driving the actions of Pete the Pig.
- Pete owns a small wooden cottage in the forest.
- Pete is late on mortgage payments for said cottage.
- Pete must collect briefcases full of money on his way to the bank, before they seize his house!

To facilitate this story and a fun game loop, here are the planned changes, features, and content:
- 10-15 more levels in the Forest Region.
- City Region with 15-20 levels.
- Bank Region with 3-5 levels, plus a boss battle.
- Refined Speedrun timer ,  per level & per run, speedrunner friendly.
- Re-worked level assets to be original.
- Re-worked soundtracks.
- Enhanced animations, particle effects and atmospheric shaders
- More obstacles and hazards.

Stay tuned, and enjoy the demo!
