# What is Apple Man Sam?

Apple Man Sam is a top-down shooter where our hero Sam the Apple battles an endless horde of vegetables.
**The Goal** is to survive as long as possible while defeating waves of vegetable enemies.
Controls are responsive with aimable camera, variety of enemies, CRT shader effects, and complete shooting, damage and score mechanics.

__Disclaimer__: Apple Man Sam features some silly coarse language. These will eventually be removed so enjoy/be puzzled by their inclusion whilst you can!

- More enemy types and behaviors.
- Power-ups and weapon upgrades.
- Multiple levels and environments.
- Enhanced CRT shader effects.
