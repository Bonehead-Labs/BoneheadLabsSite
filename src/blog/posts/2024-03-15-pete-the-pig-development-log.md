# Building Pete the Pig: A Physics-First Approach

When we started developing Pete the Pig, we knew we wanted to create something that felt different from typical platformers. The concept was simple: a pig needs to get to the bank, but the execution required careful attention to physics and player feel.

## The Physics Challenge

One of our biggest challenges was creating a physics system that felt both realistic and fun. We wanted Pete to have weight and momentum, but not so much that the game became frustrating.

```gdscript
# Example code from our physics controller
extends CharacterBody2D

@export var jump_velocity = -400.0
@export var speed = 300.0
@export var friction = 0.8
@export var acceleration = 0.2

var gravity = ProjectSettings.get_setting("physics/2d/default_gravity")

func _physics_process(delta):
    # Add gravity
    if not is_on_floor():
        velocity.y += gravity * delta
    
    # Handle jump
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and is_on_floor():
        velocity.y = jump_velocity
    
    # Handle horizontal movement with acceleration
    var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
    if direction != 0:
        velocity.x = lerp(velocity.x, direction * speed, acceleration)
    else:
        velocity.x = lerp(velocity.x, 0.0, friction)
    
    move_and_slide()
```

## Level Design Philosophy

Our approach to level design was centered around **progressive difficulty** and **teaching through gameplay**. Each level introduces one new mechanic or challenge while reinforcing previously learned skills.

### Key Design Principles:

1. **Show, Don't Tell**: Players learn mechanics through visual cues and safe practice areas
2. **Consistent Physics**: Every interaction follows the same physics rules
3. **Meaningful Obstacles**: Each challenge serves a purpose in the player's journey
4. **Forgiving Failure**: Quick respawns and generous checkpoints keep frustration low

## Technical Implementation

We built Pete the Pig using **Godot 4.2**, taking advantage of its improved physics system and node-based architecture. Here's how we structured our main systems:

### Character Controller
- **State Machine**: Handles idle, running, jumping, and falling states
- **Input Buffer**: Allows for more responsive controls with coyote time and jump buffering
- **Animation Integration**: Smooth transitions between movement states

### Camera System
- **Look-ahead**: Camera anticipates player movement direction
- **Smooth following**: Uses interpolation to avoid jarring movements
- **Boundary constraints**: Keeps important gameplay elements in view

## Challenges We Overcame

### 1. Slippery Controls
**Problem**: Initial physics made Pete feel like he was sliding on ice.
**Solution**: Implemented variable friction based on input state and surface type.

### 2. Inconsistent Jump Height
**Problem**: Jump height varied based on framerate.
**Solution**: Moved to delta-independent physics calculations and added jump buffering.

### 3. Visual Feedback
**Problem**: Players couldn't tell when they could interact with objects.
**Solution**: Added subtle particle effects and color changes for interactive elements.

## What's Next?

In our next development log, we'll cover:
- **Audio Design**: How we created Pete's distinctive sound palette
- **Art Pipeline**: From concept sketches to final sprites
- **Playtesting Results**: What we learned from our beta testers

Pete the Pig represents our commitment to creating games that feel great to play. Every system was designed with player experience in mind, and we're excited to share more of our development journey.
