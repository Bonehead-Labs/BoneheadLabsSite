# Git Workflow Guidelines

## Branch Naming
- Feature branches: `feature/description` or `Cursor-FeatureName`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/description`

## Commit Messages
Use descriptive commit messages:
- `feat: add dark mode toggle with persistent storage`
- `fix: resolve theme switching in navigation`
- `style: update code block backgrounds for dark mode`
- `refactor: replace hardcoded colors with CSS variables`

## Merge Process
1. Ensure all changes are committed on feature branch
2. Switch to main: `git checkout main`
3. Merge feature branch: `git merge feature-branch-name`
4. Delete feature branch: `git branch -d feature-branch-name`
5. Push to remote: `git push origin main`

## Before Committing
- Run `npm run build` to ensure no build errors
- Check for linter errors: `npm run lint` (if available)
- Test theme switching functionality
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes

## Deployment
Use the deploy script: `npm run deploy`
This builds the project and pushes the dist folder to the main branch for GitHub Pages deployment.
